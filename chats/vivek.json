    "message": "Building a job portal using AI and MongoDB involves several steps and technologies.  This outlines a high-level architecture and key considerations.  This isn't a complete, ready-to-run codebase, but a guide to get you started.\n\nI. Core Components:\n\n1. Frontend (User Interface):\n    * Technology: React, Angular, Vue.js, or a similar JavaScript framework are popular choices.  Consider a framework that offers good component reusability for features like job listings, company profiles, and user dashboards.\n    * Functionality:  This is where users interact with the system.  It will need forms for job seekers to create profiles, upload resumes, search for jobs, and apply.  Employers will need sections to post jobs, manage applications, and view candidate profiles.\n\n2. Backend (API & Logic):\n    * Technology: Node.js with Express.js (or similar like Python with Flask/Django, Go with Gin/Echo) is a good choice for its scalability and ease of integration with MongoDB.\n    * Functionality:  Handles all the server-side logic, database interactions, and API calls from the frontend.  This includes user authentication, job posting, search functionality, application processing, and AI integration.\n\n3. Database (MongoDB):\n    * Schema Design:  You'll need collections (tables) for:\n        * `users`: (user ID, username, password, email, resume, skills, experience, etc.)\n        * `jobs`: (job ID, title, description, company ID, location, salary, requirements, etc.)\n        * `companies`: (company ID, name, description, location, contact information, etc.)\n        * `applications`: (application ID, user ID, job ID, application date, status, etc.)\n\n4. AI Integration:\n    * Natural Language Processing (NLP):  This is crucial for several features:\n        * Job Description Parsing: Extract key skills, experience requirements, and other relevant information from job descriptions automatically.  Libraries like spaCy or NLTK (Python) can be used.\n        * Resume Parsing: Extract candidate skills, experience, education, and contact information from resumes.  Again, spaCy or NLTK are helpful.  You might also consider cloud-based NLP APIs like Google Cloud Natural Language or Amazon Comprehend for more advanced capabilities.\n        * Search Relevance: Improve search results by understanding the user's search query intent and matching it with relevant job postings using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.\n        * Recommendation System: Recommend jobs to users based on their skills and experience, using collaborative filtering or content-based filtering.\n\n    * Machine Learning (ML):  Could be used for:\n        * Candidate Matching:  Develop a model to score the suitability of candidates for specific jobs based on their resumes and the job descriptions.\n        * Salary Prediction:  Predict salary ranges for jobs based on various factors.\n\n\nII. Development Steps:\n\n1. Set up the Development Environment: Install Node.js, MongoDB, and any necessary packages (like Mongoose for MongoDB interaction in Node.js).  Choose your frontend framework and set up its development environment.\n\n2. Design the Database Schema: Create the MongoDB collections with appropriate fields and data types.\n\n3. Develop the Backend API: Create API endpoints for user authentication, job posting, job searching, application submission, and other functionalities.  Integrate MongoDB for data persistence.\n\n4. Integrate AI: Implement NLP for resume and job description parsing, search relevance improvement, and recommendation systems.  This is likely the most complex part and may require significant experimentation and iteration.  Consider starting with simpler AI features and adding more complex ones later.\n\n5. Develop the Frontend: Build the user interface, connecting it to the backend API.  Design intuitive user flows for job seekers and employers.\n\n6. Testing: Thoroughly test all functionalities, including the AI components.\n\n7. Deployment: Deploy the application to a server (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Heroku).\n\nIII. Technology Stack Example (Node.js):\n\n* Frontend: React with Material-UI (or similar component library)\n* Backend: Node.js with Express.js\n* Database: MongoDB with Mongoose\n* AI: Python (spaCy, scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch â€“ depending on your ML needs)  You might use a separate Python service that your Node.js backend communicates with via REST APIs or message queues.\n* Authentication: Passport.js (or similar)\n\n\nIV.  Important Considerations:\n\n* Scalability: Design your architecture to handle a large number of users and job postings.  Consider using load balancing and caching techniques.\n* Security: Implement robust security measures to protect user data and prevent unauthorized access.\n* Data Privacy: Comply with relevant data privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).\n\n\nThis outlines a complex project.  Break it down into smaller, manageable tasks.  Start with a minimal viable product (MVP) with basic features and gradually add more advanced AI functionalities. Remember to thoroughly test each component as you build.",
